# mau5-syphon

A Processing 3 sketch to send data to a PixelPusher via Syphon running on OSX. This skech uses a custom LED mapping `data/map.xml`. This sketch makes it possible to live preview any video from the computer. For example, I use a syphon server plugin for Adobe After Effects to edit video and preview on the head.
